\f3pcp-machine\f1 - Lua scripting engine for Performance Co-Pilot
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3pcp-machine\f1 [\f3-h\f1] [\f3-H\f1 \f2host\f1] \f2script\f1
.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pcp-machine 
is a programable query tool for Performance Co-Pilot,
.BR PCPIntro (1). 
It allows an user to query for live metrics in Lua scripts and program based on these retuned metrics.
.P
.B pcp-machine
tries to adhere to the Unix philosophy of being small and modular and is intended to be used in a pipeline with other tools.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B \-H
Query for metric in the context of \fIhost\fR. This option might be set by another tool that \fBpcp-machine\fR is using such as \fBnagios\fR(8). This option does not preclude querying against a host inside a Lua script. It is a convenience method that avoids having inject data using methods such as environment variables. Defaults to localhost.

.SH EXAMPLE SCRIPTS
Check the metric \fIkernel.all.nprocs\fR and print to the console if nprocs is over 1000.
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
nprocs = metric('kernel.all.nprocs')
if nprocs > 1000 then
  print('There are too many processes. ' .. nprocs .. ' are cunnretly running')
end
.fi
.RE
.sp
Check \fIfilesys.free\fR metric for free space on each disk for host \fImyhost.example.com\fR. Print out the disk that storage is too low and exit \fBpcp-machine\fR with an exit code of 1
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
free_space = metric('filesys.free', {host='myhost.example.com'})
for disk, bytes_free in pairs(free_space) do
  if bytes_free < 10000000 then
    print('Space on disk' .. instance .. 'is too low!')
    return 1
  end
end
print "Disks are all okay!"
return 0
